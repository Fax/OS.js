**This version is no longer in active development. Please check out version 2 in my other Github project page: http://andersevenrud.github.io/OS.js-v2**

**NOTE:** This branch will soon be deprecated. PHP, Apache and MySQL will be removed and replaced
with a Node.js backend (as originally intended). You can check out the development process in the 'node.js' branch.

# About OS.js:
OS.js is a simple, yet powerful JavaScript Cloud/Web Desktop Platform.

A live demonstration is available on http://OSjs.0o.no
Please note that this site may be down at times. To access this demo you need to register a user.

Only WebKit and Gecko based browsers fully support Glade/Gtk+ due to incomplete implementation of various
CSS features.

OS.js can also be deployed standalone, either running in a browser or on top of X11 as a complete Graphical Environment.
